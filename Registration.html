      <!--
      <h1>DELIVERABLES</h1>
      <p>
        All teams are required to submit:<br />

        A completed registration form for all contributing team members.<br />
        Team Leaders are expected to complete this form no later than 11/13 at 11:59PM ET or you risk not receiving
        communication on how to submit your game. You will be able to make edits after submission.<br />
        Team Members have until 11/16 at 11:59PM ET to complete the registration form at which point the form will close
        for
        everyone.<br />
        A Game Description Form which describes your team, experience, and your overall vision for your game, even if
        you were
        unable to completely execute a playable game.<br />
        Great ideas are eligible for non-technical awards consideration as long as this document is completed!<br />
        The deadline for submission of this form is 11/16 at 11:59PM so we suggest you wait until close to the end of
        the Game
        Jam OR after your entry is submitted to complete this form.<br />
        To be eligible for all awards and advancement in the judging process, you must also submit:<br />

        A playable demo of your game. This should include at least one example of every mechanic and system in your
        game. While
        your ambitions may be larger (“We’ll have 40 levels!”) a single, complete example of everything you can do is
        enough for
        the contest.<br />
        A readme.txt file that includes any special installation instructions, explanation of game controls (press “E”
        to use
        things), and credits (who did what) that would include any assets that you include under license (royalty free
        music,
        creative commons 3D models, etc.)<br />
        Documentation of your process. This could be a link to a developer’s blog, a video (or link to a video)
        documenting what
        you did, or a photo gallery of screenshots (and captions!) showing where you started and what you accomplished.
        (You
        will be able to upload these or provide links to these in the Game Description Form)
      </p>
      <h1></h1>
      <p>Each team’s game jam submission must be uploaded by the Team Leader. Submissions must be in the form a single
        .zip
        folder (how to create .zip folders: Windows MacOS Linux) that includes the following:

        The game executable and its necessary files unless your game is web-based. For web-based games, you must include
        the URL
        for the game as the first line of your readme.txt (see below).
        A readme.txt with an explanation of game controls (such as “press E to interact with items”), credits (who did
        what)
        that would include any assets that your team used under license (royalty free music, creative commons 3D models,
        etc.),
        the URL for your team’s devblog, any special installation instructions, and (optionally) a URL for the game’s
        front-facing webpage if one was made.
        The .zip folder itself must use the “gamename-teamleader” naming convention. No uppercase letters, spaces, or
        special
        characters besides “-” should be used. Example: “fivenightsatfreddys-scottcawthon.zip”
        A .zip folder that only contains a readme.txt is perfectly acceptable for web-based game submissions. Your
        team’s .zip
        folder must be uploaded to TBD before the deadline at 6:00 PM ET on Sunday, November 15th. Teams leaders should
        begin
        uploading their team’s submission no later than two hours before the deadline to ensure that the upload is
        completed on
        time. If the file is large (>1.5 GB), expect a longer upload time.
